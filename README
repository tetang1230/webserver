Function
========

Implements a simple webserver


Usage
=====

This program has been written for instructional and demonstration
purposes only. It is missing a number of vital security features. Do
NOT run it on any machine connected to an external network!!


Installation
============

If you run gcc under Linux, just type:

    make

Otherwise, compile and link all the *.c files into a single executable
in your usual manner.

主要更改 resource.c 中static char server_root[1000] = "/home/chester/html";
然后添加些html文件测试

端口更改文件在webserv.c中,当前默认是8080
